# QuizME

## Description

QuizME is designed to be an online learning platform that allows users to create, study, and share flashcards and other learning materials. It is available both as a website and as a mobile application. The website version can be accessed through a web browser on various devices, while the app version can be downloaded and installed on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.

### Features

- **Flashcards:** flashcards

- **Quizzes:** flashcards

- **Timed Matching Game:** flashcards

- **Live Quiz Game:** A kahoot-esque study game that uses AI for the answer choices

- **Study Modes:**

- **Progress Tracking:**

### What I Learned

Throughout the development of my QuizME, several valuable lessons were learned:

## Compiling

### Mobile Dependencies
Java (version 20.0.1 or higher)

Make sure you have Java installed on your system. You can check the installed Java version by running the following command in the terminal or command prompt: `java -version`

If Java is not installed, you can download it from the official [website](https://www.java.com/en/download/)

## Future Improvements

QuizME has a lot of potential for further enhancements and features. Here are some ideas for future improvements:

To develop something similar to Quizlet, you would need to consider the following steps:

Define the Purpose and Features: Determine the specific purpose and features of your learning platform. Identify the core functionality you want to provide, such as flashcards, quizzes, study modes, progress tracking, and social sharing.

Design the User Interface: Create wireframes and design mockups to visualize how the website and app will look and function. Pay attention to user experience (UX) and ensure that the interface is intuitive and easy to navigate.

Backend Development: Set up the server-side infrastructure to handle user registration, authentication, and data storage. Choose a suitable technology stack based on your preferences and requirements. Common choices include JavaScript frameworks like Node.js for server-side development and databases like MySQL or MongoDB for data storage.

Frontend Development: Develop the user interface for both the website and the mobile app. You can use web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the website, while mobile app development may require additional frameworks such as React Native (for cross-platform development) or Swift/Kotlin (for native iOS/Android development).

Flashcard Creation and Management: Implement features that allow users to create, edit, and organize their flashcards. Provide options for text, images, and audio attachments to enhance the learning experience.

Study Modes and Quizzes: Create different study modes such as flip cards, multiple-choice quizzes, and matching exercises. Implement algorithms to randomize questions and track user progress.

Social Features: Add social elements like user profiles, following/follower systems, and the ability to share flashcard sets with others. Implement features for users to collaborate on creating and editing flashcards.

Analytics and Progress Tracking: Develop mechanisms to track user performance, generate study statistics, and provide insights into progress. This can include features like a study history, performance graphs, and reminders.

Testing and Quality Assurance: Thoroughly test your platform for bugs, usability issues, and performance optimizations. Engage beta testers to gather feedback and make improvements based on their experiences.

Deployment and Maintenance: Deploy your website and mobile app to hosting servers and publish the app to relevant app stores. Regularly update and maintain your platform to address any issues, introduce new features, and provide a seamless user experience.

Remember that developing a comprehensive learning platform like Quizlet requires a combination of skills, including frontend and backend development, UI/UX design, and database management. You may need a team of developers and designers or invest time in acquiring these skills yourself.
